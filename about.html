        <div class="technique-section">
            <p>Contemporary newspaper accounts describe Singh as a strategic and intelligent runner. His approach to middle-distance racing combined tactical awareness with raw speed, making him particularly effective in the half-mile distance where both qualities were essential. Unlike pure sprinters or marathon runners, Singh possessed the rare combination of speed and endurance that defined the greatest middle-distance athletes of his era.</p>
            
            <div class="racing-philosophy">

                    <li><strong>Finishing Kick:</strong> Possessed a devastating final sprint that often overwhelmed competitors in the final 200 meters</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental Toughness:</strong> Demonstrated exceptional competitive spirit and the ability to perform under pressure</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintained high performance levels across two decades of competition</li>

            <div class="community-impact">
                <h4>Beyond Personal Glory</h4>
