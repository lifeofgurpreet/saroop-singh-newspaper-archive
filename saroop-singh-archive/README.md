## Migration Notes

This project has been restructured from a single directory to a monorepo. Original content:
- CMS raw-files and articles remain in `packages/cms/`
- Old family photos moved to `shared/assets/images/`
- Image generation content moved to `shared/assets/restorations/`
- Jekyll site files remain in the parent directory during transition

## Legacy Structure

The original project structure contained:
- `raw-files/` - Original scanned newspaper images
- `output/articles/` - Processed Markdown articles
- Various shell scripts for processing
- Jekyll-based website files

These have been reorganized into the monorepo structure for better maintainability and scalability.
