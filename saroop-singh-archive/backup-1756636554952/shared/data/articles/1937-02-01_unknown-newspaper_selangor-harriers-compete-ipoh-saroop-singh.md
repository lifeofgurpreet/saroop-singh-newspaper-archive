THE Selangor Harriers, who are expected to be the strongest civilian team to compete in the forthcoming inter-team cross-country competition in Ipoh, will be represented by eight to be selected from the following, among whom are some excellent runners.

Duabia a promising youngster, who in his first competition lost only to the best man; Edgar de Silva, and Saroop Singh, budding long distance runners who are well known in athletic circles, and A.
