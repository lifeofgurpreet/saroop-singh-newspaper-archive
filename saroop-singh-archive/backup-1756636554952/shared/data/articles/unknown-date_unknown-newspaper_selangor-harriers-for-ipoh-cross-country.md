Kuala Lumpur.
The Selangor Harriers will be represented by the following runners in the forthcoming Inter-team Cross-country Race in Ipoh: A. Theivendiram, Henderson, Woodrow, R. S. Daubia, Edgar de Silva, Saroop Singh, A. Thomas, Bahrun, M. Thomas, Thavaraja, Katar Singh and Rajoo.

The team as a whole are expected to offer any team the strongest opposition. A.
