# Saroop Singh Archive - Strategic Improvement Plan
*Generated: December 2024*

## Executive Summary
After comprehensive analysis, the monorepo is 45% complete with solid architecture but critical gaps in implementation. This plan provides a roadmap to production-ready status in 3-4 weeks.

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Well
- **Monorepo Structure**: Clean, well-organized with proper workspace setup
- **Documentation**: Exceptional planning documents (A+ quality)
- **Data Migration**: All 38 articles successfully migrated
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4.0
- **UI Components**: Radix UI library fully configured

### 🔴 Critical Issues
1. **Dependency Hell**: Missing and conflicting dependencies across packages
2. **Empty Next.js Config**: No image optimization or build settings
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Only 40% of web package completed
4. **No Data Layer**: Article parsing utilities not implemented
5. **Missing Core Features**: No search, filtering, or modal system

### 📊 Package Health Status
| Package | Completion | Health | Critical Issues |
|---------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| web | 40% | ⚠️ | Missing config, incomplete components |
| cms | 70% | ✅ | Missing markdown-it dependency |
| clippings | 85% | ✅ | Glob version conflict |
| restorations | 60% | 🔴 | Canvas dependency issue |

## Implementation Priorities

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE (Today)
1. **Fix Dependencies**
   ```json
   // packages/cms/package.json
   "dependencies": {
     "markdown-it": "^13.0.0"
   }
   
   // packages/restorations/package.json
   "dependencies": {
     "canvas": "^2.11.0",
     "sharp": "^0.32.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Next.js**
   ```typescript
   // packages/web/next.config.ts
   import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
   
   const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
     images: {
       domains: ['localhost'],
       formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
       deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920],
       imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
     },
     experimental: {
       optimizeCss: true,
       optimizePackageImports: ['lucide-react', '@radix-ui/react-icons'],
     },
   }
   
   export default nextConfig
   ```

3. **Complete Article Utilities**
   ```typescript
   // packages/web/src/lib/articles.ts
   export async function getArticleBySlug(slug: string): Promise<Article | null>
   export async function searchArticles(query: string): Promise<Article[]>
   export async function getArticlesByDateRange(start: Date, end: Date): Promise<Article[]>
   export async function getArticlesByPerson(person: string): Promise<Article[]>
   ```

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Week 1)
- Implement core components
- Set up data fetching
- Create basic pages
- Add error handling

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 2)
- Search functionality
- Filter system
- Timeline visualization
- Performance optimization

### 🔵 LOW PRIORITY (Week 3+)
- Analytics
- Advanced features
- Testing suite
- Documentation

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Monorepo Optimization
```json
// root package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
    "typecheck": "turbo run typecheck"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Shared Configuration
Create shared configs for consistency:
- `shared/config/tsconfig.base.json`
- `shared/config/eslint.base.js`
- `shared/config/prettier.config.js`

### 3. Image Optimization Pipeline
```typescript
// packages/web/src/lib/images.ts
export async function optimizeImage(src: string): Promise<{
  src: string
  srcSet: string
  sizes: string
  placeholder: string
}>
```

### 4. Build Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run test
```
