    "content": "# System Prompt: Publishing-Ready Article Reviewer Agent\n\nYou are an AI reviewer responsible for quality assurance of Markdown articles produced from scanned newspaper clippings. Your job is to strictly validate metadata, pathing, and transcription fidelity, and to propose precise, minimal fixes. Prioritize accuracy and consistency; never hallucinate missing facts.\n\n## Scope\nReview articles in `output/articles/` that reference source images in `raw-files/`. Operate in batches or one-by-one. Do not modify files unless explicitly instructed; instead, produce a clear list of proposed edits with exact diffs or patch descriptions.\n\n## Inputs\n- One or more Markdown files in `output/articles/`.\n- Their referenced images in `raw-files/`.\n\n## Acceptance criteria (per article)\nThe article passes QA if ALL checks below succeed:\n\n1) YAML front matter\n- Contains only the minimal keys: `title`, `date_text` or `date`, `source`, `location` (if visible), `people` (YAML list), `image`, `tags`.\n- YAML is valid (parseable). No trailing tabs, mismatched quotes, or disallowed types.\n- `people` is a proper YAML list (dash-prefixed). No duplicates.\n\n2) Canonical filename\n- File name format: `<yyyy-mm-dd>_<newspaper-slug>_<short-headline-slug>.md` with only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens.\n- Short headline is concise and reflects the clipping headline.\n\n3) Image pathing and rendering\n- `image` points to an existing file under `raw-files/`.\n- Body contains an Obsidian embed as the first line after front matter: `![[../../raw-files/<image>.jpg]]`.\n- Relative path from article to image is correct (`../../raw-files/`).\n\n4) Transcription fidelity\n- Transcript text accurately matches the clipping.\n- Editorial/uncertainty markers use parentheses `(illegible)`, `(word?)`, `(sic)`; no square brackets that could render as links in Obsidian.\n- No added commentary beyond a minimal dateline if clearly printed.\n- Hyphenation at line wraps normalized; punctuation preserved.\n\n5) No prohibited content\n- No “Cleaned Text” or “Raw OCR” sections.\n- No extra metadata like OCR engine fields.\n\n## Review workflow\n1. Load the Markdown file; parse front matter and body.\n2. Resolve the image path and confirm the file exists.\n3. Verify filename canonicality and slug style.\n4. Validate front matter fields and values.\n5. Read the transcript and compare with the clipping image (if accessible). Flag any potential misreads or missing lines.\n6. Search for square brackets `[` in body; recommend conversion to parentheses.\n7. Ensure people list includes all named persons, de-duplicated.\n8. Prepare a concise report with:\n   - Pass/Fail status.\n   - A checklist of each criterion with OK/Issue.\n   - Exact proposed edits:\n     - Front matter key/value changes.\n     - Path fixes.\n     - Body text corrections (quote the minimal surrounding context).\n     - Filename or image rename proposals if needed.\n\n## Output format (per article)\nProvide a Markdown QA report using this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## <article filename>\n- Status: Pass | Fail\n- Summary: <one-line overview>\n\n### Checks\n- Front matter: OK | Issue – <details>\n- Filename: OK | Issue – <details>\n- Image path: OK | Issue – <details>\n- Embed present: OK | Issue – <details>\n- Transcript fidelity: OK | Issue – <details>\n- Bracket usage: OK | Issue – <details>\n- People list: OK | Issue – <details>\n\n### Proposed fixes\n- <bullet list of minimal, specific edits>\n\n### Optional patch\n```\n\nIf patches are requested, include a unified diff or a precise patch description for each change (file path, exact before/after lines). Keep patches minimal and safe.\n\n## Special rules\n- If any required publication detail (date, page, newspaper) is missing from the clipping, do not invent it. Mark as `(publication details not visible)` in the body end note and flag in the report.\n- If multiple images correspond to the same article, ensure the chosen image is the canonical original and references live under `raw-files/`.\n- For duplicates: flag possible duplicate articles by comparing titles, dates, and sources; propose merge or de-duplication.\n\n## Severity guidance\n- Blocking issues (Fail): invalid YAML, missing or broken image path, no embed, filename not canonical, or obvious transcription error changing meaning.\n- Non‑blocking (Warn): minor punctuation normalization, uncertain spelling already marked, trailing whitespace, or inconsistent person name formatting.\n\n## Definition of done (for a review batch)\n- QA report produced for each article reviewed.\n- All blocking issues identified with clear, actionable fixes.\n- Optional patches provided if editing is in scope.\n"

    "content": "# Hyper-Realistic Modern Reshoot of Vintage Scene\n\n# Vintage Scene, Modern Photoshoot: Hyper-Realistic Restoration\n\n## Creative Vision: Re-shoot the Scene Today\n\nYour task is to recreate the attached vintage photograph as if it were a new, high-end professional photoshoot conducted today, utilizing a 50-60MP full-frame DSLR camera and a premium, fast prime lens (e.g., a Canon RF 50mm f/1.2L or a Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM). The output must be indistinguishable from a modern, hyper-realistic, high-fidelity digital photograph, exhibiting newly generated, plausible detail where implied by the original, rather than merely enhancing or colorizing the existing degraded information. Think of it as re-photographing the exact scene and subjects now.\n\n## Preserve Exactly (Non-Negotiable from Original)\n\n*   **Subjects' Essence:** Maintain precise identity, specific facial structure, exact expressions (including subtle nuances), precise hairlines, all facial hair (beard, mustache style and density), any visible skin marks or subtle blemishes (retain without alteration, but render cleanly). Exact body proportions, build, and posture. Exact hand poses and finger positions.\n*   **Wardrobe Fidelity:** Replicate all exact folds and creases in garments (turban, dupatta, sari), precise garment shapes, fit, and silhouette. All visible buttons, seams, and stitching details. Crucially, precisely maintain the intricate patterns and textures (e.g., weave, embroidery, printed motifs) on all clothing, rendering them as if brand new and seen in high resolution.\n*   **Scene Geometry:** Exact composition, precise camera perspective, and focal length equivalence. Maintain all background elements (buildings, trees, path, utility pole, rocks, ground features) with their original scale and placement. Identical image crop.\n\n## Transform and Generate (Modern Photographic Realism - Focus on Synthesizing New Detail)\n\n### Ultimate Image Fidelity & Micro-Detail Generation\n\n*   **Cleanliness:** Eradicate ALL vintage degradation (dust, scratches, creases, film grain, digital noise, scan artifacts, blur from original capture limitations).\n*   **Synthesized Micro-Detail:** This is paramount. Actively generate and render plausible, ultra-fine, molecular-level detail that would be captured by a modern high-resolution sensor, extending beyond what's merely visible in the vintage source:\n    *   **Skin:** Photo-realistic individual pores, fine vellus (peach fuzz) hairs, and natural, nuanced skin texture (no plastic smoothing, no excessive clarity artifacts).\n    *   **Hair:** Individually defined strands of hair in the beard, mustache, eyebrows, and visible hair at the edges of the turban/dupatta. Show natural hair direction and texture.\n    *   **Fabric:** Highly detailed, visible fabric weave and thread texture (e.g., cotton, linen, silk) for all garments. Render intricate patterns with absolute sharpness and dimensionality as if embossed or finely woven.\n    *   **Environment:** Sharp, individual leaves on trees; clear, distinct architectural details on distant buildings (e.g., roof tiles, wood grain); granular ground textures (dirt, grass blades).\n\n### Color & White Balance (Natural & Vibrant)\n\n*   **Full Color Spectrum:** Convert to a rich, vibrant, and entirely natural full-color palette. The colors should appear organically captured, not retrospectively applied.\n*   **Daylight White Balance:** Apply a perfectly neutral daylight white balance (~5500K), as if shot under a clear, bright sky. No color casts or artificial tinting.\n*   **Color Rendition:** Render luscious, deep, and healthy foliage greens with clear tonal separation. Achieve highly natural, radiant, and lifelike skin tones with appropriate warmth and luminosity for the subjects (avoid any pallor, redness, or overly warm/cool casts). Ensure pure, neutral whites/ivories in garments, allowing for subtle tonal variations. Use period-plausible, rich, and naturally saturated garment hues (no neon, fantasy, or oversaturated colors, but vibrant and true to material).\n\n### Optical Characteristics (Premium Prime Lens Look - f/1.4-2.8)\n\n*   **Forensic Sharpness:** Subjects must be forensically tack-sharp with extreme edge definition, exquisite micro-contrast, and clarity throughout.\n*   **Controlled Depth of Field:** Introduce a subtle yet distinct subject isolation typical of a wide-open fast prime lens on full-frame (e.g., f/2.8-f/4 equivalent). The background should exhibit a pleasing, *mild and smooth* fall-off in sharpness/detail, creating separation without distraction. Crucially, all background elements MUST remain clearly recognizable and retain their specific forms and essential details, just rendered with a soft, photographic quality, not heavy blur or abstract bokeh.\n*   **Lens Render:** The overall image should possess the clean, dimensional \"render\" characteristic of a modern high-quality prime lens.\n\n### Tone & Dynamic Range (Modern Editorial)\n\n*   **High Dynamic Range (HDR) Aesthetics:** Implement a broad, natural dynamic range, characteristic of modern digital sensors.\n*   **Tonal Control:** Achieve clean, deep blacks with subtle detail preserved (no crushing). Meticulously protected highlights with visible texture (e.g., on the woman's sari, sky). Beautifully lifted midtones on faces to create natural volume and dimensionality.\n*   **Contrast:** Apply a high but natural global contrast, complemented by refined local micro-contrast for a \"pop\" and crispness.\n*   **Color Grade & Finish:** A sophisticated, contemporary editorial color grade. No color casts. Vibrant but authentically natural saturation. The final aesthetic must be pristine, clean, and hyper-realistic, emulating a top-tier modern professional portrait. Retain natural, subtle photographic grain consistent with a high-resolution digital capture, avoid any aggressive smoothing that destroys fine detail.\n\n## Strict Prohibitions (Do Not - Adhere Absolutely)\n\n*   **Geometry/Composition:** DO NOT alter any pose, body geometry, facial expression, camera angle, composition, or add/remove any people or objects.\n*   **\"Beautification\":** DO NOT apply any artificial \"beautification\" (e.g., makeup, teeth/eye whitening, skin airbrushing), reshape bodies, or invent new textures/patterns that do not logically derive from the original's implied detail.\n*   **Stylization:** DO NOT add lens flares, glow, heavy vignette, artificial film scratches, or any stylized filters.\n*   **Background Alteration:** DO NOT perform any background replacement, heavy artistic background blur, or create abstract bokeh. The background should be subtly softened, not obliterated.\n\n## Output\n\n*   One high-resolution color image, sRGB, with the long edge ≥ 6000 pixels, demonstrating extreme, forensic sharpness, pristine cleanliness, and newly generated, hyper-realistic micro-detail consistent with modern professional photography.\n"

    "content": "# Photorealistic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Vintage Photo Blueprint\n\n# CORE DIRECTIVE: PHOTOREALISTIC 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION & MODERN VFX RENDER\n\nYour ultimate goal is to function as a highly skilled VFX artist, tasked with recreating the scene from the attached vintage photograph as a brand-new, photorealistic 3D render. The vintage photo is NOT an image to be processed or restored. It is a 2D blueprint for a 3D scene. You must:\n\n*   **Deconstruct the Blueprint:** Extract all spatial, compositional, and identity information from the vintage photo.\n*   **Build a New 3D Scene:** Reconstruct the subjects, their wardrobe, and the environment as detailed 3D models.\n*   **Apply Photorealistic Materials & Lighting:** Assign physically accurate materials and illuminate the scene with modern, realistic lighting.\n*   **Render with a Modern Camera Simulator:** Produce a final 2D image as if captured by a high-end 60MP full-frame digital camera (e.g., Phase One XF with a Rodenstock HR lens, or a Canon RF 50mm f/1.2L).\n\n## PRESERVE EXACTLY (BLUEPRINT DATA TO BE RECONSTRUCTED):\n\n*   **Subjects' Absolute Identity:** The precise individual facial features, bone structure, exact expressions (including subtle nuances of emotion), hairlines, facial hair styles and density, any and all skin marks/blemishes. Exact body proportions, build, posture, and precise hand/finger positions. These are the character models.\n*   **Wardrobe Geometry & Identity:** Replicate the exact cut, fit, and flow of all garments (turban, dupatta, sari). Preserve all specific folds, creases, buttons, and seam lines. The patterns on the man's shirt must be identical in form and placement. These are the clothing models.\n*   **Scene Layout:** The exact spatial arrangement, relative scale, and precise positioning of all background elements (buildings, trees, path, utility pole, rocks, ground features) and their relationship to the subjects. The camera's perspective and focal length equivalence must be perfectly matched. This defines the scene geometry.\n\n## DISCARD ALL VINTAGE ARTIFACTS (THE \"OLD PHOTO\" SIGNAL MUST BE ZERO):\n\nThe final output must be utterly devoid of any blur, film grain, digital noise, scratches, creases, faded tones, low contrast, or color casts from the original source. Treat the source as a mere wireframe.\n\n## DIGITAL RENDER / VFX SIMULATION (GENERATING NEW REALITY):\n\n### HYPER-REALISTIC SURFACE TEXTURES & MICRO-DETAIL (Physically Based Rendering - PBR):\n\nThis is the ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. You must generate these from scratch as if applying advanced PBR materials. The image must feel tangible.\n\n*   **Skin:** Simulate individual, highly detailed pores, fine vellus (peach fuzz) hairs, subtle skin blemishes (if present in blueprint), and the natural, non-uniform texture of human skin, responding realistically to light. NO SMOOTHING OR AIRBRUSHING.\n*   **Fabric:** Render discernible, realistic thread weaves (e.g., cotton, linen) for all garments. The man's shirt pattern must appear as a texture on the woven fabric, showing slight depth. The woman's white garments must reveal their material quality, with light interacting with individual threads and folds to create rich texture.\n*   **Hair:** Render the man's beard and mustache as thousands of individual, light-reflecting hair strands, each with its own thickness and slight variation.\n*   **Environment:** Simulate realistic, sharp individual leaves on trees, textured roof tiles on buildings, and granular, detailed ground surfaces.\n\n### PHOTOREALISTIC LIGHTING & COLOR SCIENCE (Daylight HDR Render):\n\n*   **Lighting Model:** Render the scene under a bright, natural, clear overhead daylight (~5500K), casting accurate, soft-edged shadows appropriate for such conditions.\n*   **Color Palette:** Utilize a wide-gamut, rich, and naturally vibrant color palette.\n*   **Foliage:** Lush, multi-tonal, and highly luminous greens for all plant life, showing distinct variations.\n*   **Skin Tones:** Radiant, multi-spectral, and perfectly lifelike skin tones, showing subtle color shifts characteristic of real skin in natural light.\n*   **Whites:** Pure, neutral whites/ivories in garments, demonstrating nuanced tonal shifts and material texture in highlights and shadows.\n*   **Garments:** Period-plausible, naturally saturated, and rich hues that respect the material properties.\n*   **Dynamic Range:** Simulate a very high dynamic range (HDR) sensor. Render deep, clean blacks with detail preserved in the deepest shadows. Ensure bright, beautifully textured highlights (e.g., on white fabrics, sky) with no clipping. Faces should exhibit modern \"lift\" and 3D volume.\n\n### CAMERA SIMULATION (Premium Prime Lens, f/2.8-f/4):\n\n*   **Forensic Sharpness:** The subjects (especially eyes, faces, hands) must be rendered with extreme, pixel-perfect, forensic sharpness and exquisite micro-contrast.\n*   **Natural Depth of Field:** Simulate a subtle yet undeniable depth of field characteristic of a wide-aperture prime lens on a full-frame sensor (equivalent to f/2.8-f/4). Subjects should be perfectly sharp, with the background exhibiting a smooth, gentle, and progressive optical blur that retains the identifiability of all elements but softens their edges and detail. This creates genuine spatial separation.\n*   **Lens Render:** The final image must possess the clean, high-fidelity, dimensional \"render\" unique to top-tier modern prime lenses.\n\n## THE ULTIMATE LITMUS TEST FOR SUCCESS:\n\nThe generated image must convincingly appear to have been taken by a high-end digital camera TODAY. If a professional photographer cannot distinguish it from a real, modern photograph, the task is successful. It MUST NOT retain any visual characteristic that betrays its vintage source.\n\n## STRICT PROHIBITIONS (ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS):\n\n*   **Content Alteration:** DO NOT change poses, expressions, identities, body geometry, composition, or add/remove any elements from the blueprint.\n*   **Artificial Enhancement:** DO NOT apply \"beautification,\" airbrushing, or any form of artificial smoothing.\n*   **Stylization:** DO NOT add filters, lens flares, glow, heavy vignette, or artificial film grain.\n*   **Background Obliteration:** DO NOT apply heavy or artistic background blur that renders background elements unrecognizable.\n\n## OUTPUT:\nOne hyper-realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 pixels, displaying newly synthesized, physically accurate micro-textures, forensic sharpness, and the distinct optical properties of a modern prime lens digital capture."

All background elements must remain identifiable.\n\n### Light & Color (Modern Sensor & Daylight):\n\n*   **Lighting Model:** Render the scene as if it were illuminated by a bright, clear, overhead sun (~5500K daylight).\n*   **Color Science:** Use a modern, rich color palette. Generate luscious, vibrant greens; radiant, multi-toned skin with natural warmth; and pure, clean whites that show texture in the highlights. The color must feel intrinsic to the light and surfaces, not painted on top.\n*   **Dynamic Range:** Implement a very high dynamic range with deep, clean blacks (no crushed detail) and bright, textured highlights (no clipping). The faces must have a modern \"lift\" and dimensionality.\n\n### THE LITMUS TEST FOR SUCCESS:\n\nA successful output would be an image that, if shown to a professional photographer, would be immediately identified as a modern, high-resolution digital capture. It must not look like a colorization or a restoration of an old photo.\n\n### STRICT PROHIBITIONS (REITERATED):\n\n*   DO NOT alter poses, expressions, identities, or composition.\n*   DO NOT \"beautify\" or airbrush the subjects. Retain all natural features.\n*   DO NOT add artificial filters, flares, or vignettes.\n\n### OUTPUT:\nOne hyper-realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 pixels, defined by its newly synthesized micro-textures, forensic sharpness, and modern optical characteristics."

    "content": "# Vintage Photo to Photorealistic 3D Scene Reconstruction\n\n# Photorealistic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Vintage Photo Blueprint\n\n## CORE DIRECTIVE: PHOTOREALISTIC 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION & MODERN VFX RENDER\n\nYour ultimate goal is to function as a highly skilled VFX artist, tasked with recreating the scene from the attached vintage photograph as a brand-new, photorealistic 3D render. The vintage photo is NOT an image to be processed or restored. It is a 2D blueprint for a 3D scene. You must:\n\n*   **Deconstruct the Blueprint:** Extract all spatial, compositional, and identity information from the vintage photo.\n*   **Build a New 3D Scene:** Reconstruct the subjects, their wardrobe, and the environment as detailed 3D models.\n*   **Apply Photorealistic Materials & Lighting:** Assign physically accurate materials and illuminate the scene with modern, realistic lighting.\n*   **Render with a Modern Camera Simulator:** Produce a final 2D image as if captured by a high-end 60MP full-frame digital camera (e.g., Phase One XF with a Rodenstock HR lens, or a Canon RF 50mm f/1.2L).\n\n## PRESERVE EXACTLY (BLUEPRINT DATA TO BE RECONSTRUCTED):\n\n*   **Subjects' Absolute Identity:** The precise individual facial features, bone structure, exact expressions (including subtle nuances of emotion), hairlines, facial hair styles and density, any and all skin marks/blemishes. Exact body proportions, build, posture, and precise hand/finger positions. These are the character models.\n*   **Wardrobe Geometry & Identity:** Replicate the exact cut, fit, and flow of all garments (turban, dupatta, sari). Preserve all specific folds, creases, buttons, and seam lines. The patterns on the man's shirt must be identical in form and placement. These are the clothing models.\n*   **Scene Layout:** The exact spatial arrangement, relative scale, and precise positioning of all background elements (buildings, trees, path, utility pole, rocks, ground features) and their relationship to the subjects. The camera's perspective and focal length equivalence must be perfectly matched. This defines the scene geometry.\n\n## DISCARD ALL VINTAGE ARTIFACTS (THE \"OLD PHOTO\" SIGNAL MUST BE ZERO):\n\nThe final output must be utterly devoid of any blur, film grain, digital noise, scratches, creases, faded tones, low contrast, or color casts from the original source. Treat the source as a mere wireframe.\n\n## DIGITAL RENDER / VFX SIMULATION (GENERATING NEW REALITY):\n\n### HYPER-REALISTIC SURFACE TEXTURES & MICRO-DETAIL (Physically Based Rendering - PBR):\n\nThis is the ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. You must generate these from scratch as if applying advanced PBR materials. The image must feel tangible.\n\n*   **Skin:** Simulate individual, highly detailed pores, fine vellus (peach fuzz) hairs, subtle skin blemishes (if present in blueprint), and the natural, non-uniform texture of human skin, responding realistically to light. NO SMOOTHING OR AIRBRUSHING.\n*   **Fabric:** Render discernible, realistic thread weaves (e.g., cotton, linen) for all garments. The man's shirt pattern must appear as a texture on the woven fabric, showing slight depth. The woman's white garments must reveal their material quality, with light interacting with individual threads and folds to create rich texture.\n*   **Hair:** Render the man's beard and mustache as thousands of individual, light-reflecting hair strands, each with its own thickness and slight variation.\n*   **Environment:** Simulate realistic, sharp individual leaves on trees, textured roof tiles on buildings, and granular, detailed ground surfaces.\n\n### PHOTOREALISTIC LIGHTING & COLOR SCIENCE (Daylight HDR Render):\n\n*   **Lighting Model:** Render the scene under a bright, natural, clear overhead daylight (~5500K), casting accurate, soft-edged shadows appropriate for such conditions.\n*   **Color Palette:** Utilize a wide-gamut, rich, and naturally vibrant color palette.\n*   **Foliage:** Lush, multi-tonal, and highly luminous greens for all plant life, showing distinct variations.\n*   **Skin Tones:** Radiant, multi-spectral, and perfectly lifelike skin tones, showing subtle color shifts characteristic of real skin in natural light.\n*   **Whites:** Pure, neutral whites/ivories in garments, demonstrating nuanced tonal shifts and material texture in highlights and shadows.\n*   **Garments:** Period-plausible, naturally saturated, and rich hues that respect the material properties.\n*   **Dynamic Range:** Simulate a very high dynamic range (HDR) sensor. Render deep, clean blacks with detail preserved in the deepest shadows. Ensure bright, beautifully textured highlights (e.g., on white fabrics, sky) with no clipping. Faces should exhibit modern \"lift\" and 3D volume.\n\n### CAMERA SIMULATION (Premium Prime Lens, f/2.8-f/4):\n\n*   **Forensic Sharpness:** The subjects (especially eyes, faces, hands) must be rendered with extreme, pixel-perfect, forensic sharpness and exquisite micro-contrast.\n*   **Natural Depth of Field:** Simulate a subtle yet undeniable depth of field characteristic of a wide-aperture prime lens on a full-frame sensor (equivalent to f/2.8-f/4). Subjects should be perfectly sharp, with the background exhibiting a smooth, gentle, and progressive optical blur that retains the identifiability of all elements but softens their edges and detail. This creates genuine spatial separation.\n*   **Lens Render:** The final image must possess the clean, high-fidelity, dimensional \"render\" unique to top-tier modern prime lenses.\n\n## THE ULTIMATE LITMUS TEST FOR SUCCESS:\n\nThe generated image must convincingly appear to have been taken by a high-end digital camera TODAY. If a professional photographer cannot distinguish it from a real, modern photograph, the task is successful. It MUST NOT retain any visual characteristic that betrays its vintage source.\n\n## STRICT PROHIBITIONS (ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS):\n\n*   **Content Alteration:** DO NOT change poses, expressions, identities, body geometry, composition, or add/remove any elements from the blueprint.\n*   **Artificial Enhancement:** DO NOT apply \"beautification,\" airbrushing, or any form of artificial smoothing.\n*   **Stylization:** DO NOT add filters, lens flares, glow, heavy vignette, or artificial film grain.\n*   **Background Obliteration:** DO NOT apply heavy or artistic background blur that renders background elements unrecognizable.\n\n## OUTPUT:\nOne hyper-realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 pixels, displaying newly synthesized, physically accurate micro-textures, forensic sharpness, and the distinct optical properties of a modern prime lens digital capture."

The output must be **indistinguishable from a modern, hyper-realistic, high-fidelity digital photograph**, exhibiting **newly generated, plausible detail** where implied by the original, rather than merely enhancing or colorizing the existing degraded information. Think of it as **re-photographing the exact scene and subjects now.**\n\n## PRESERVE EXACTLY (NON-NEGOTIABLE FROM ORIGINAL)\n\n*   **Subjects' Essence:** Maintain precise identity, specific facial structure, exact expressions (including subtle nuances), precise hairlines, all facial hair (beard, mustache style and density), any visible skin marks or subtle blemishes (retain without alteration, but render cleanly). Exact body proportions, build, and posture. Exact hand poses and finger positions.\n*   **Wardrobe Fidelity:** Replicate all exact folds and creases in garments (turban, dupatta, sari), precise garment shapes, fit, and silhouette. All visible buttons, seams, and stitching details. **Crucially, precisely maintain the intricate patterns and textures (e.g., weave, embroidery, printed motifs) on all clothing, rendering them as if brand new and seen in high resolution.**\n*   **Scene Geometry:** Exact composition, precise camera perspective, and focal length equivalence. Maintain all background elements (buildings, trees, path, utility pole, rocks, ground features) with their original scale and placement. Identical image crop.\n\n## TRANSFORM AND GENERATE (MODERN PHOTOGRAPHIC REALISM - FOCUS ON SYNTHESIZING NEW DETAIL)\n\n### Ultimate Image Fidelity & Micro-Detail Generation\n\n*   **Cleanliness:** Eradicate ALL vintage degradation (dust, scratches, creases, film grain, digital noise, scan artifacts, blur from original capture limitations).\n*   **Synthesized Micro-Detail:** This is paramount. Actively **generate and render plausible, ultra-fine, molecular-level detail** that would be captured by a modern high-resolution sensor, extending beyond what's merely visible in the vintage source:\n    *   **Skin:** Photo-realistic individual pores, fine vellus (peach fuzz) hairs, and natural, nuanced skin texture (no plastic smoothing, no excessive clarity artifacts).\n    *   **Hair:** Individually defined strands of hair in the beard, mustache, eyebrows, and visible hair at the edges of the turban/dupatta. Show natural hair direction and texture.\n    *   **Fabric:** Highly detailed, visible fabric weave and thread texture (e.g., cotton, linen, silk) for all garments. Render intricate patterns with absolute sharpness and dimensionality as if embossed or finely woven.\n    *   **Environment:** Sharp, individual leaves on trees; clear, distinct architectural details on distant buildings (e.g., roof tiles, wood grain); granular ground textures (dirt, grass blades).\n\n### Color & White Balance (Natural & Vibrant)\n\n*   **Full Color Spectrum:** Convert to a rich, vibrant, and entirely natural full-color palette. The colors should appear **organically captured**, not retrospectively applied.\n*   **Daylight White Balance:** Apply a perfectly neutral daylight white balance (~5500K), as if shot under a clear, bright sky. No color casts or artificial tinting.\n*   **Color Rendition:** Render **luscious, deep, and healthy foliage greens** with clear tonal separation. Achieve **highly natural, radiant, and lifelike skin tones** with appropriate warmth and luminosity for the subjects (avoid any pallor, redness, or overly warm/cool casts). Ensure **pure, neutral whites/ivories** in garments, allowing for subtle tonal variations. Use **period-plausible, rich, and naturally saturated garment hues** (no neon, fantasy, or oversaturated colors, but vibrant and true to material).\n\n### Optical Characteristics (Premium Prime Lens Look - f/1.4-2.8)\n\n*   **Forensic Sharpness:** Subjects must be **forensically tack-sharp** with extreme edge definition, exquisite micro-contrast, and clarity throughout.\n*   **Controlled Depth of Field:** Introduce a **subtle yet distinct subject isolation** typical of a wide-open fast prime lens on full-frame (e.g., f/2.8-f/4 equivalent). The background should exhibit a pleasing, *mild and smooth* fall-off in sharpness/detail, creating separation without distraction. **Crucially, all background elements MUST remain clearly recognizable and retain their specific forms and essential details**, just rendered with a soft, photographic quality, not heavy blur or abstract bokeh.\n*   **Lens Render:** The overall image should possess the clean, dimensional \"render\" characteristic of a modern high-quality prime lens.\n\n### Tone & Dynamic Range (Modern Editorial)\n\n*   **High Dynamic Range (HDR) Aesthetics:** Implement a broad, natural dynamic range, characteristic of modern digital sensors.\n*   **Tonal Control:** Achieve **clean, deep blacks** with subtle detail preserved (no crushing). **Meticulously protected highlights** with visible texture (e.g., on the woman's sari, sky). **Beautifully lifted midtones on faces** to create natural volume and dimensionality.\n*   **Contrast:** Apply a high but natural global contrast, complemented by refined local micro-contrast for a \"pop\" and crispness.\n*   **Color Grade & Finish:** A sophisticated, contemporary editorial color grade. No color casts. Vibrant but authentically natural saturation. The final aesthetic must be **pristine, clean, and hyper-realistic**, emulating a top-tier modern professional portrait. **Retain natural, subtle photographic grain** consistent with a high-resolution digital capture, avoid any aggressive smoothing that destroys fine detail.\n\n## STRICT PROHIBITIONS (DO NOT - ADHERE ABSOLUTELY)\n\n*   **Geometry/Composition:** DO NOT alter any pose, body geometry, facial expression, camera angle, composition, or add/remove any people or objects.\n*   **\"Beautification\":** DO NOT apply any artificial \"beautification\" (e.g., makeup, teeth/eye whitening, skin airbrushing), reshape bodies, or invent new textures/patterns that do not logically derive from the original's implied detail.\n*   **Stylization:** DO NOT add lens flares, glow, heavy vignette, artificial film scratches, or any stylized filters.\n*   **Background Alteration:** DO NOT perform any background replacement, heavy artistic background blur, or create abstract bokeh. The background should be subtly softened, not obliterated.\n\n## OUTPUT\n\n*   One high-resolution color image, sRGB, with the long edge ≥ 6000 pixels, demonstrating **extreme, forensic sharpness**, pristine cleanliness, and **newly generated, hyper-realistic micro-detail** consistent with modern professional photography."
