```

### Airtable Base Template
Use the following JSON structure to create fields programmatically via API:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Title",
      "type": "singleLineText"
    },
    {
      "name": "Status",
      "type": "singleSelect",
      "options": {
        "choices": [
          {"name": "Pending", "color": "grayLight2"},
          {"name": "Queued", "color": "yellowLight2"},
          {"name": "Processing", "color": "orangeLight2"},
          {"name": "Complete", "color": "greenLight2"},
          {"name": "Failed", "color": "redLight2"}
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Processing Job ID",
      "type": "singleLineText"
    },
    {
      "name": "Result URL",
      "type": "url"
    },
    {
      "name": "Process",
      "type": "button"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Data Validation
1. **Photo/Image URL**: Must contain valid image file or URL
2. **Status**: Must be one of the defined options
3. **Processing Job ID**: Should be UUID format when present
4. **Result URL**: Must be valid URL when present

### Business Rules
1. Cannot process without Photo/Image URL
2. Job ID should be unique across all records
3. Status should progress logically: Pending → Queued → Processing → Complete/Failed
4. Result URL should only be populated when Status is "Complete"

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing
- Create indexes on frequently filtered fields:
  - Status
  - Processing Job ID
  - Last Updated
  - Batch ID

### Record Limits
- Batch processing: Limit to 50-100 records per batch
- Concurrent jobs: Max 5-10 simultaneous processing jobs
- API rate limits: Respect Airtable's 5 requests per second limit

### Cleanup Strategy
- Archive completed jobs older than 6 months
- Delete failed jobs after manual review
- Maintain audit log of all processing activities

This database setup provides a robust foundation for automated photo restoration with full tracking, error handling, and batch processing capabilities.
