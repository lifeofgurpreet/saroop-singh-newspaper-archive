Only one record was broken, the half mile in which Saroop Singh knocked off a second from the existing record of 2 mins. 6 4/5 secs.\n\nThe average standard of the performances were good without being brilliant and the showings augur well for Selangor's chances in Malayan sports. Of course, Selangor have the advantage of a home track without the necessity for travelling which can be such a disadvantage to athletes. In any case, with the good performances registered in many parts of the country during the last few weeks we are anxiously awaiting the sports. A few records are sure to go by the board.",
