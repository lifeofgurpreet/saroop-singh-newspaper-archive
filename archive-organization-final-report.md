# Saroop Singh Newspaper Archive - Organization Final Report

## Project Summary

Successfully reorganized the Saroop Singh newspaper archive by resolving the PHOTO file naming issue and establishing proper correspondence between image files and their associated articles.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete File Mapping ✅
- Created comprehensive mapping of all 41 PHOTO files
- Identified 22 files currently used in articles
- Identified 19 unused files for further evaluation

### 2. Systematic File Renaming ✅
- Renamed 22 PHOTO files from meaningless timestamps to meaningful names
- New filenames match their corresponding article canonical names
- Examples:
  - `PHOTO-2025-08-30-21-56-34 3.jpg` → `1940-02-07_straits-times_cross-country-race-on-saturday.jpg`
  - `PHOTO-2025-08-30-21-56-48 2.jpg` → `1940-08-07_straits-times_st-john-ambulance-brigade-sports-saroop-singh.jpg`

### 3. Article Reference Updates ✅
- Updated all 22 articles with new image filenames
- Updated both frontmatter (`image:`) and content (`![[]]`) references
- All image links now work correctly with meaningful filenames

### 4. Duplicate Analysis ✅
- Analyzed all 19 unused PHOTO files for potential duplicates
- **Result: No true duplicates found** - all files have different sizes
- Files with similar timestamps appear to be different versions/crops/resolutions rather than exact duplicates
