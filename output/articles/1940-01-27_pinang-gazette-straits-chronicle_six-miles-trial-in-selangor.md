CROSS-COUNTRY RACE

Six Miles' Trial In Selangor

Kuala Lumpur.
The annual Selangor cross-country race fought out between the Police Depot and the Selangor Harriers will be run off today at 5 p.m. As in former years, the race will be staged over a course of approximately six miles.

The Police Depot won the match last year, but chances this year are very open both for the Depot and the Harriers as Jaswant Singh, the Depot runner who finished well ahead of his rivals has left the state.

The Selangor Harriers, however, have a good number of well-known distance runners in Saroop Singh, M. Thomas and Theivendiram, although Anderson, a former Blackheath Harriers member will not be available owing to a strained muscle.

Coming as it is before the Malayan cross-country race to be held at Ipoh shortly, this race should provide possible State representatives for the forthcoming Malayan meet.
