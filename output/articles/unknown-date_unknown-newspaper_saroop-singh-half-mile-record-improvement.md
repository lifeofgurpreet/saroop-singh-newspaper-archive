As the goal average method has been done away with, a replay seems to be looming ahead, for Perak are fancied against the weak Penang side. Of course, if the Northern Settlement bring off a coup, Selangor will be in the final for the 11th time.

The only other sports item of interest, the boxing having been cancelled owing to the refusal of the Boxing Board to sanction the card, was the annual meeting of the Selangor Amateur Athletic Association. Only one record was broken, **the half mile in which Saroop Singh knocked off a second from the existing record of 2 mins 6 4/5 secs**.

The average standard of the performances were good without being brilliant and the showings augurs well for Selangor's chances in the Malayan sports. Of course, Selangor have the advantage of a home track without the necessity for travelling which can be such a disadvantage to athletes. In any case with the good performances registered in many parts of the country during the last few weeks we are anxiously awaiting the sports. A few records are sure to go by the board.
