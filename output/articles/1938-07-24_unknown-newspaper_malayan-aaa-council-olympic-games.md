There will be a meeting of the Malayan A.A.A. Council on Saturday July 24, when the venue of the Malayan 1938 championship meeting will be discussed.

It is to be hoped that serious consideration be given to the associating attitude to the forthcoming Olympic Games in Japan. If action is delayed until next year it will be too late.

It will be no difficult matter as regards expense to send a small athletic team from Malaya.

It is understood that Japanese shipping lines will make a reduction of 50 per cent on fares, and that when in Japan each competitor is allowed one U.S. gold dollar a day to help towards expenses.

With athletes smashing records right and left in Malaya the time seems ripe for some fresh impetus to be given the sport, particularly when the venue of the games is so close to Malaya.

ATHLETIC GATHERING

Next Friday and Saturday will see a great gathering of athletes at Kuala Lumpur for the Malayan championship meeting.

In flat races and field events it looks as if Singapore athletes are going to walk off with the majority of the titles, but in the jumps they certainly will not have their own way.

On the first day of the Selangor A.A Championship meeting Lee Yin Thong cleared 10 ft. 6 ins. in the pole vault to break the Malayan record of 10 ft. 3¼ ins. established by Colin Boyd five years ago.

At Penang the Chinese schoolboy who is credited with having cleared 6 ft. 2½ ins. in the high jump also cleared 11 ft. 0¼ ins. in the pole vault. Penang records are not recognised by the Malayan A.A.A.

The Singapore pole vaulter, Tan Aik Keng, has been over 10 ft. 6 ins. in practice although he was unable to record more than 10 ft. in the adverse conditions prevailing at the Singapore meeting.

UNABLE TO GO

Loh Wah Kit, the Singapore high jumper is not making the trip. O. Ang, the Chinese javelin thrower, is also unavailable, along with Ghumanda Singh (Police) holder of the Malayan shot putt record.

Hossen Arjan Singh (Police) last year's winner of putting the weight is going up, and will probably fight the title out with A. C. Fraser of the Gordons. The latter should have no difficulty in annexing the discus title.

FLAT RACES

Poh Kim Seng and M. K. Sundram should monopolise the two sprints and the 440 yards, if they are up to form.

Pte. Clubb, holder of the Malayan record 2 min. 2 sec. for the half mile will meet at present (illegible) in the Sikh runner, Saroop Singh who (text cuts off)
