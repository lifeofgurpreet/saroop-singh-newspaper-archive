(From Our Own Correspondent)
Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 1.

THE Selangor Harriers, who are expected to be the strongest civilian team to compete in the forthcoming inter-team cross-country race competition in Ipoh, will be represented by eight to be selected from the following, among whom are some excellent runners.

A. Theivendiram, perhaps the best civilian long distance runner in Malaya to-day: Messrs. Henderson and Woodrow, both from well known Harriers' Clubs in England; Edgar de Silva, a promising youngster, who in his first competition lost only to the best man; Thomas and Saroop Singh, and budding long distance runners who are well known in M. F. athletic circles; and A. Thomas, Bahrun, M. Thomas, Thavaraja, Katar Singh, and Rajoo.
