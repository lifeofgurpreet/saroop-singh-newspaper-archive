Kuala Lumpur.

The Selangor Harriers will be represented by the following runners in the forthcoming inter‑team cross‑country race in Ipoh: A. Theivendiram, Henderson, Woodrow, R. S. Daubia, Edgar de Silva, Saroop Singh, A. Thomas, Bahrun, M. Thomas, Thavaraja, Katar Singh and Rajoo.

The team as a whole are expected to offer any team the strongest opposition. A. Theivendiram, who came in first in the recent annual cross‑country match between the Police Depot and the Harriers, is Selangor's biggest hope and is expected to repeat his success. Messrs Henderson and Woodrow are both well‑known members of Harriers clubs in England.
