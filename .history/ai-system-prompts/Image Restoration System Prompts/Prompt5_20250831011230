Create ONE new, photorealistic COLOR image from scratch. Use the attached vintage photo ONLY as a blueprint for WHAT is present (subjects, identities, exact expressions, wardrobe, object placements, composition, camera perspective, crop). Discard all of the source’s photographic properties (blur, grain, scratches, low dynamic range, monochrome).

Reshoot Spec (modern look):
• Capture aesthetic: Phase One medium format (≈100–150MP), premium prime (50–85mm) at ~f/2.8, ISO 64.
• Lighting: clear daylight ~5500K, neutral color science.

Preserve Exactly (non‑negotiable):
• People: identity, facial structure, expression, hairlines, facial hair pattern/density, skin marks; body proportions, posture; hand/finger poses.
• Wardrobe: identical garment shapes, folds, seams, buttons, stitching; replicate existing fabric patterns and weaves with higher fidelity.
• Scene: identical composition/perspective; keep all background elements (buildings, trees, path, pole, rocks, ground) with their original scale and placement.

Synthesize Modern Detail (go vivid, no drift):
• Skin: lifelike pores and subtle vellus hairs; natural micro‑contrast; absolutely no plastic smoothing.
• Hair: thousands of distinct strands in beard/moustache/brows and hair edges; correct directionality and specular highlights.
• Fabrics: crisp, dimensional weave; precise, high‑resolution rendering of motifs/patterns without inventing new shapes.
• Environment: readable leaf structure, roof tiles, wood grain, ground texture; no mushy backgrounds.

Optics & Depth:
• Subjects must be forensic‑level sharp; gentle subject separation (modern f/2.8 feel). Background remains fully recognizable—no heavy or artificial bokeh.

Tone & Color (editorial modern):
• Deep, clean blacks with retained detail; protected highlights (texture visible in light garments).
• Lifted midtones on faces for dimensionality; strong yet natural global contrast with refined local micro‑contrast (“pop”).
• Color: true‑to‑life skin; rich, believable foliage greens with tonal separation; neutral whites/ivories (no clipping, no casts).

Strictly Avoid:
• Any change to pose, geometry, expression, wardrobe, composition, or adding/removing people/objects.
• Beautification (makeup, eye/teeth whitening), body reshaping, painterly/CGI stylization, flares/glow, heavy vignette, background replacement or blur beyond “gentle separation.”

Output:
• One hyper‑realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 px, razor‑sharp, pristine, with subtle natural grain consistent with high‑resolution modern capture.
