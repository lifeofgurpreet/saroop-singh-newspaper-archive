Create ONE new, photorealistic COLOR image from scratch, using the attached vintage photo solely as the blueprint for content (identities, expressions, wardrobe, object placements, composition, perspective, crop). Replace the source’s photographic qualities with a modern, cinematic golden‑hour reshoot.

Reshoot Spec (cinematic but faithful):
• Capture aesthetic: Phase One medium format (≈100–150MP), premium prime (50–85mm) at ~f/1.8–f/2.8, ISO 64.
• Lighting: low‑angle golden‑hour sunlight (~4600–5000K) with soft, directional warmth and gentle wrap; no artificial flare.

Locks (preserve exactly):
• People: identity, facial structure, expressions, hairlines, facial hair density/pattern, natural skin marks; body proportions, posture; hand/finger poses.
• Wardrobe: identical shapes/folds/silhouettes; authentic seam/stitch/button detail; replicate existing fabric patterns and weave topology at higher fidelity.
• Scene: composition and camera perspective unchanged; all background elements kept with original scale and placement.

Modern Photographic Rendering:
• Micro‑texture generation is mandatory: realistic skin pores and fine vellus hairs; individual hair strands in beard/moustache/brows; 3D fabric weave and precise motifs; environment textures (leaves/roof tiles/wood/ground) rendered with contemporary clarity.
• Depth: subjects tack‑sharp with tasteful subject isolation (wide‑aperture prime feel). Background softly eased but fully legible—no heavy bokeh or replacement.
• Color: warm, luminous skin tones consistent with golden hour; foliage with rich yet believable greens; whites/ivories remain clean and textured (no clipping, no strong casts).
• Tone/DR: deep blacks with preserved shadow detail; bright, textured highlights; elevated midtones on faces for natural volume; high micro‑contrast without halos.

Prohibitions:
• No changes to geometry, poses, expressions, wardrobe, composition; no additions/removals.
• No beautification, body reshaping, neon/fantasy colors, stylized filters, flares/glow, heavy vignette, or painterly/AI‑art looks.

Output:
• One hyper‑realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 px; contemporary cinematic polish with extreme clarity and newly synthesized, plausible micro‑detail.
