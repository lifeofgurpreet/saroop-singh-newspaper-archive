# About the Archive

## Project Overview

The Saroop Singh Newspaper Archive is a digital preservation project dedicated to documenting the athletic history of colonial Malaya through newspaper clippings from 1937 to 1954. This archive focuses particularly on the career of Saroop Singh, a prominent athlete of the era, and his contemporaries in the Malayan athletic scene.

## Historical Context

During the late colonial period, athletics played a significant role in Malayan society. Track and field events brought together diverse communities and provided a platform for local athletes to gain recognition. The newspaper clippings in this archive capture not just race results and records, but also provide glimpses into the social and cultural fabric of pre-independence Malaya.

## The Collection

Our archive contains digitized newspaper clippings from various publications including:

- **Singapore Free Press** - One of the major English-language newspapers of the era
- **Morning Tribune** - Coverage of morning sports events
- **Straits Times** - The region's oldest newspaper
- **Malaya Tribune** - Local sports coverage
- Various other regional publications

Each clipping has been:
- Carefully digitized from original sources
- Transcribed faithfully to preserve historical accuracy
- Tagged with metadata for searchability
- Organized chronologically for easy browsing

## Preservation Methodology

### Transcription Standards

- Illegible sections marked as (illegible)
- Uncertain readings marked with (?)
- Editorial notes in parentheses to maintain readability

### Digital Standards
- High-resolution scans of original clippings
- Structured metadata using YAML frontmatter
- Markdown format for long-term preservation and accessibility
- Version control through Git for tracking changes
