# Vintage Photo Restoration: Photorealistic Color Image with Modern Detail

## Photorealistic Color Image Generation from Vintage Blueprint

Create one new, photorealistic COLOR image from scratch. The attached vintage photo will serve **ONLY** as a blueprint for **WHAT** is present (subjects, identities, exact expressions, wardrobe, object placements, composition, camera perspective, crop). All of the source's photographic properties (blur, grain, scratches, low dynamic range, monochrome) must be discarded.

### Reshoot Specification (Modern Look)

*   **Capture Aesthetic:** Phase One medium format (≈100–150MP), premium prime (50–85mm) at ~f/2.8, ISO 64.
*   **Lighting:** Clear daylight ~5500K, neutral color science.

### Non-Negotiable Preservations

*   **People:** Identity, facial structure, expression, hairlines, facial hair pattern/density, skin marks; body proportions, posture; hand/finger poses.
*   **Wardrobe:** Identical garment shapes, folds, seams, buttons, stitching; replicate existing fabric patterns and weaves with higher fidelity.
*   **Scene:** Identical composition/perspective; keep all background elements (buildings, trees, path, pole, rocks, ground) with their original scale and placement.

### Synthesized Modern Detail (Vivid, No Drift)

*   **Skin:** Lifelike pores and subtle vellus hairs; natural micro-contrast; absolutely no plastic smoothing.
*   **Hair:** Thousands of distinct strands in beard/moustache/brows and hair edges; correct directionality and specular highlights.
*   **Fabrics:** Crisp, dimensional weave; precise, high-resolution rendering of motifs/patterns without inventing new shapes.
*   **Environment:** Readable leaf structure, roof tiles, wood grain, ground texture; no mushy backgrounds.

### Optics & Depth

*   **Sharpness:** Subjects must be forensic-level sharp.
*   **Depth:** Gentle subject separation (modern f/2.8 feel). Background remains fully recognizable—no heavy or artificial bokeh.

### Tone & Color (Editorial Modern)

*   **Contrast:** Deep, clean blacks with retained detail; protected highlights (texture visible in light garments). Lifted midtones on faces for dimensionality; strong yet natural global contrast with refined local micro-contrast (“pop”).
*   **Color:** True-to-life skin; rich, believable foliage greens with tonal separation; neutral whites/ivories (no clipping, no casts).

### Strict Avoidances

*   Any change to pose, geometry, expression, wardrobe, composition, or adding/removing people/objects.
*   Beautification (makeup, eye/teeth whitening), body reshaping, painterly/CGI stylization, flares/glow, heavy vignette, background replacement or blur beyond “gentle separation.”

### Output

*   One hyper-realistic sRGB color image, long edge ≥ 6000 px, razor-sharp, pristine, with subtle natural grain consistent with high-resolution modern capture.
